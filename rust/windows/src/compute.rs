//! Capture copies and colour conversion on D3D12 compute queues.
//!
//! D3D11 work waits behind whatever a game has queued on the GPU's graphics
//! engine: beside a game using the whole GPU, the D3D11 colour conversion
//! took 7 ms instead of 0.9 ms and a plain copy 8 ms instead of 0.7 ms. A
//! compute queue runs next to the graphics engine and finished the same
//! work in 0.2-0.3 ms under that load (`examples/d3d12_probe.rs`,
//! `examples/gpu_load.rs`). Captured frames are copied into shared textures
//! on one compute queue ([`Handoff`]) and converted to the encoder's YUV
//! format on another ([`Converter`]); the encoder waits for the conversion's
//! fence on the GPU.
